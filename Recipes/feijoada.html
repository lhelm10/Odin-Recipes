    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Feijoada is a black bean and pork stew that is often served with farofa, toasted cassava flour.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dry black beans</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces slab bacon</li>
        <li>1 pound pork ribs</li>
        <li>2 chorizo sausages</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>farofa</li>
        <li>rice</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl with water, soak beans overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large heavy-bottom soup pot, over medium heat, add the oil and bacon. Cook until crisp and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Use the same saucepan to brown ribs and sausages in batches. Set each aside as cooked.</li>
        <li>On medium-high, saut√© onion and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with the ribs, bacon, sausages, salt, pepper, bay leave. Cover with water (about 8 cups).</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it cook for 2 to 2 and a half hours, or until the beans are soft.</li>
        <li>If the stew is too liquidy, uncover the saucepan and continue to cook for another 20 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate.</li>
        <li>Serve with white rice and sprinkle some farofa on top.</li>
    </ol>
