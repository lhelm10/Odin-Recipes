        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour olive oil, water, milk, and salt into a large saucepan, and place over high heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, remove from heat immediately, and stir in tapioca flour and garlic until smooth. Set aside to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
